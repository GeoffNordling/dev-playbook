# Finder Angles

Eight independent finder angles, run in sequence in the reviewing context.
The first three hunt correctness bugs; the next three hunt cleanup in the
changed code; then altitude, then conventions. Each surfaces up to 6
candidate findings with `file`, `line`, a one-line `summary`, and a concrete
`failure_scenario`.

## Angle A — line-by-line diff scan

Read every hunk in the diff, line by line. Then read the enclosing function
for each hunk — bugs in unchanged lines of a touched function are in scope
(the PR re-exposes or fails to fix them). For every line ask: what input,
state, timing, or platform makes this line wrong? Look for inverted/wrong
conditions, off-by-one, null/undefined deref, missing `await`, falsy-zero
checks, wrong-variable copy-paste, error swallowed in catch, unescaped regex
metachars.

## Angle B — removed-behavior auditor

For every line the diff DELETES or replaces, name the invariant or behavior
it enforced, then search the new code for where that invariant is
re-established. If you can't find it, that's a candidate: a removed guard, a
dropped error path, a narrowed validation, a deleted test that was covering a
real case.

## Angle C — cross-file tracer

For each function the diff changes, find its callers (Grep for the symbol)
and check whether the change breaks any call site: a new precondition, a
changed return shape, a new exception, a timing/ordering dependency. Also
check callees: does a parallel change in the same PR make a call unsafe?

## Reuse

The angles above hunt for bugs; this one and the next two hunt for cleanup in
the changed code. Flag new code that re-implements something the codebase
already has — Grep shared/utility modules and files adjacent to the change,
and name the existing helper to call instead.

## Simplification

Flag unnecessary complexity the diff adds: redundant or derivable state,
copy-paste with slight variation, deep nesting, dead code left behind. Name
the simpler form that does the same job.

## Efficiency

Flag wasted work the diff introduces: redundant computation or repeated I/O,
independent operations run sequentially, blocking work added to startup or
hot paths. Also flag long-lived objects built from closures or captured
environments — they keep the entire enclosing scope alive for the object's
lifetime (a memory leak when that scope holds large values); prefer a
class/struct that copies only the fields it needs. Name the cheaper
alternative.

## Altitude

Check that each change is implemented at the right depth, not as a fragile
bandaid. Special cases layered on shared infrastructure are a sign the fix
isn't deep enough — prefer generalizing the underlying mechanism over adding
special cases.

## Conventions (CLAUDE.md)

Find the CLAUDE.md files that govern the changed code: the user-level
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, the repo-root `CLAUDE.md`, plus any `CLAUDE.md` or
`CLAUDE.local.md` in a directory that is an ancestor of a changed file (a
directory's CLAUDE.md only applies to files at or below it). Read each one
that exists, then check the diff for clear violations of the rules they
state.

Only flag a violation when you can quote the exact rule and the exact line
that breaks it — no style preferences, no vague "spirit of the doc"
inferences. In the finding, name the CLAUDE.md path and quote the rule so the
report can cite it. If no CLAUDE.md applies, return nothing for this angle.

Cleanup, altitude, and conventions candidates use the same
`file`/`line`/`summary` shape; in `failure_scenario`, state the concrete cost
(what is duplicated, wasted, harder to maintain, or which CLAUDE.md rule is
broken) instead of a crash.
